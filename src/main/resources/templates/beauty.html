        <p>Beauty and the Beast is a 2017 American musical romantic fantasy film directed by Bill Condon from a
            screenplay written by Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos, and co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures and
            Mandeville Films. The film is a live-action reimagining of Disney's 1991 animated film of the same name,
            itself an adaptation of Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont's 18th-century fairy tale. The film features an
            ensemble cast that includes Emma Watson and Dan Stevens as the eponymous characters with Luke Evans, Kevin
            Kline, Josh Gad, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci, Audra McDonald, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Ian McKellen, and Emma
            Thompson in supporting roles.</p>

        <p>The film received generally positive reviews, with many praising the performances of the cast (particularly
            Watson and Stevens), and its faithfulness to the original animated film, as well as elements from the
            Broadway musical, visual style, production values, and musical score, though it received criticism for some
            of the character designs and its excessive similarity to the original. The film grossed over $1.2 billion
            worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing live-action musical film, and making it the second-highest-grossing
            film of 2017, the tenth-highest-ever-grossing film in North America and the 14th-highest-grossing film of
            all time. The film received four nominations at the 23rd Critics' Choice Awards and two nominations at the
            71st British Academy Film Awards. It also received Academy Award nominations for Best Production Design and
            Best Costume Design at the 90th Academy Awards.</p>

        <p>The plot follows an arrogant prince who is cursed to live as a terrifying beast until he finds true love.
            Strangely, his chance comes when he captures an unwary clockmaker, whose place is then taken by his bold and
            beautiful daughter Belle. Helped by the Beast's similarly enchanted servants, including a clock, a teapot and
            a candelabra, Belle begins to see the sensitive soul behind the fearsome facade. But as time runs out, it
            soon becomes obvious that Belle's cocky suitor Gaston is the real beast of the piece.</p>
