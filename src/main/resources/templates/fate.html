        <p>The Fate of the Furious' plot follows Dominic Toretto (Diesel), who has settled down with his wife Letty

            against his team, forcing them to find Dom and take down Cipher</p>

        <p>The Fate of the Furious grossed $226 million in the United States and Canada and $1.010 billion in other
            territories for a worldwide total of $1.236 billion, against a production budget of $250 million ($350
            million including marketing costs). It is Universal Pictures' most ambitious worldwide distribution release
            in the studio's history. The film was released day-and-date in 64 territories worldwide, including almost
            all major markets (minus Japan), starting from April 12, 2017, and was projected to earn anywhere between
            $375â€“440 million in its five-day opening weekend. By the end of the weekend, it ended up earning $539.9
            million from nearly 23,000 screens, way above initial projections, to score the biggest global opening in
            cinematic history. It also marked the third time that a film earned over $500 million in a single weekend,
            after Star Wars: The Force Awakens ($529 million) and Jurassic World ($525.5 million). In IMAX, the film
            made $31.1 million from 1,079 screens to record the biggest IMAX April debut and the fourth-biggest overall.</p>

        <p>On April 30, it crossed the $1 billion threshold, becoming the second release of 2017 (
            following Beauty and the Beast), the fifth film released by Universal Pictures (after Jurassic Park, Furious
            7, Jurassic World, and Minions) and the thirtieth film overall in cinematic history to gross over $1 billion.
            It is currently the third-highest-grossing film of the year, behind Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and Beauty and
            the Beast, the second-biggest action film that is not a fantasy or superhero movie, behind Furious 7, and is
            Universal's highest-grossing live-action release since Jurassic World back in June 2015.
            The Fate of the Furious concluded 2017 as the third highest-grossing film of the year worldwide.</p>
